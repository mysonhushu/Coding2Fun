			"What is Type System ?\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"In programming languages, a type system is a collection of rules that assign a property called type to various constructs a computer program consists of, such as variables, expressions, functions or modules.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"To understand type system we are going to use Scala language as our vehicle. Type parameter allows us to define methods or classes in terms of type that will be specified later. It’s like creating a placeholder for the type, which we can configure and define. Type parameterization allows you to write generic classes and methods.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"For example In Java List<T> can be defined as List<String>, List<Integer>, List<Double>, etc. Similarly in scala or any other language we can define it.\r\n" + 
			"\r\n" + 
			"To understand type system, we need to look into Variance and Bounds\r\n" +
