Mortgage,"this is regarding several issues with the mortgage account with wells fargo , whom i have had the worst experience of dealing with for any type of resolution there are many areas , but the most egregious action that wells fargo has been co mingling funds from my mortgage account to pay the balance for an escrow amount \( my mortgage account is escrow impounded \) and reporting that i 'm underpaying my mortgage payment amount , and reporting to credit bureaus that i 'm late on my payments this has ruined my credit report with negative items of late payment when the payments from my checking account cleared well ahead of delinquent date this would have to considered a financial fraud to co mingle funds when my payment is strictly principal interest this bank has been playing judge jury '' in regards to this escrow amount when they decided that there was a lapse in coverage and no 3rd party independent of both sides could say , yes , the lapse in coverage is legitimate '' regardless , of whether it is legitimate , the co mingling of funds , reporting late to bureaus , tacking on late fees , and manipulation of payments showing inaccurate principal balance is beyond one 's imagination"
Mortgage,"on xxx xxx xxx , we refinanced our mortgage through xxx xxx created a note and deed of trust , later placing our note into a pool of trust known as xxx loan trust xxx now documentation shows that xxx xxx mortgage does not own this note or deed of trust xxx xxx mortgage went chapter xxx in xxx delaware in xxx then , documentation shows that goldman sachs purchased this note deed of trust in xxx from the xxx xxx mortgage trustee in xxx , xxx bank which is the trustee for this note and trust \( xxx loan trust xxx \) stated in an email that xxx funding is the issuer of the asset backed security this company is technically the owners of this note as of xxx , per xxx bank the trustee ! now , xxx funding and all of it 's affiliates went chapter xxx in xxx delaware in xxx and was ordered to sell all their assets on multiple occasions , i had sent certified letters to our servicers , xxx bank , goldman sachs and requested to know who owns or who is the investor of our note , i also requested assignments going all the way back to new xxx mortgage so i can know who were the previous investors and who the current investor of our note is as of today , no one has provided the information that i had requested now everyone has been talking about the xxx movie this movie was based on actual events , regarding the build up of the housing and credit bubble during the xxx in xxx , eccentric hedge fund manager xxx xxx discovered that the xxx housing market is extremely unstable , being based on subprime loans that are high risk and providing fewer and fewer returns predicting that the market will collapse sometime in the second quarter of xxx , he realizes that he can profit from this situation by creating a credit default swap market , allowing him to bet against the housing market later , trader xxx xxx hears of xxx actions and soon realizes that xxx predictions are likely true he decides to put is own stake in the credit default swap market then a phone call was placed to hedge fund manager xxx xxx to alert him the xxx discovered that the impending market collapse is being further perpetuated by the sale of collateralized debit obligations \( cdos \) , groups poor loans that are packaged together and given fraudulent xxx ratings due to the conflict of interest and dishonesty of the rating agencies the market as you well know collapsed just as xxx xxx predicted and he produced 489 profits from the plan ! now i believe that these large companies , banks or investors failed to keep track of there mortgage assignments which are required to prove ownership of the asset backed security like our note deed of trust ! our note deed of trust was placed into xxx loan trust xxx xxx are the letters for goldman sachs reality which is a company that is owned by goldman sachs i also believe that goldman sachs like other banks and investors took part of these fraudulent activities xxx loan trust does not own our note deed of trust i believe that goldman sachs and xxx bank is not providing who the current investor is , possibly due to fraud and no assignments are available which would prove ownership of our note deed of trust !"

Mortgage,"during the application of for the loan the loan officer was told not to pull credit until he enquired with underwriters about various conditions related to the loan he was also told not to pull credit if he was working with more than xxx borrower on the loan to spite our warnings to him , the lender was working with more than xxx party and failed to disclose this to us he also did not check on all the underwriting conditions prior to pulling our credit once he pulled our credit , along with the other borrowers and ran the concerns by underwriting after pulling credit , he noted that his branch had an overlay issue due to a recent purchase of another home we had informed him of this prior to him pulling credit this issue is a standard xxx issue and for wells fargo is usually an automatic turn down as they typically sell their loans immediately we had already contacted another lender who did not have the same concerns regarding the overlay they could have done our loan the problem here is that the wells fargo lender realized that he would not be able to do the loan on this particular house if the builder allowed us to purchase it , as we were in first position to go under contract on the home so , this lender informed the builder that we had too many red flags , and they should proceed with the other buyer through his actions he would be able to do the loan and receive the commission regarding this property this home was the last of its kind and came at a substantially reduced price the builder is no longer building this floor plan , and if they were it would be about xxx more expensive the lender did not call us to communicate that he was unable to do the loan he only communicated with the builders agents this was a breach of his fiduciary duty to us as we had not signed an agreement that would allow him to speak with anyone regarding our credit or buying potential he also pulled credit without authorization causing our credit score to drop we had specifically warned him against pulling credit if he was working with another borrower on the same home , and yet he pulled our credit on the same day as the other borrower our credit , debt to income ratios , and down payment requirements all fell in line we did not have several red flags , only an overlay issue that another lender could have overcome because of this we lost the home and the potential for about xxx worth of built in equity because of the credit pull , our score has now dropped enough that it would not be wise to try to find another home and restart this process we have opted to build on to our existing home but will not be able add enough square footage to compare with the home we lost because of this lender i believe the behavior of this lender is his standard operating procedure in this event many qualified home buyers lose out on the homes that they would like to buy as this lender puts his needs for a commission above his clients need to purchase the home this lender does not understand that he does not have the right to a dual fiduciary duty , nor does he understand the damage that he does by pulling multiple parties credit for the same home please contact me in regards to filing a formal complaint i will not be buying another builders home to avoid being put into this situation again i have worked in lending and real estate for many years and i would never treat a client the way we were treated in this situation"
